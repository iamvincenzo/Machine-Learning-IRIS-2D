# Machine-Learning-IRIS-2D

In this repository you can find two machine-learning example and one example used to evaluate the two different algorithms.

Iris dataset contains 3 classes of 50 instances each, where each class refers to a type of iris plant. 

  Labels:

  1. sepal length in cm
  2. sepal width in cm
  3. petal length in cm
  4. petal width in cm

  Class:

  1. Iris Setosa
  2. Iris Versicolour
  3. Iris Virginica

In "mainRF.py" is used Random Forest algorithm to classify items contained in iris-dataset.

In "mainSVM.py" is used Support Vector Machine algorithm to classify items contained in iris-dataset.

In "mainClfEvaluation.py" there are different method used to evaluate the goodness of an agorithm.
